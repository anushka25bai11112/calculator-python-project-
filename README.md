# 📰 Fake News Headline Generator

A simple Python script designed to generate humorous and nonsensical "breaking news" headlines by randomly combining subjects, actions, and places/things from predefined lists.

## ✨ Features

* **Randomized Headlines:** Generates a new, unique headline on demand.
* **Simple Command-Line Interface:** Easy to run and interact with.
* **Humorous Output:** Creates outlandish and entertaining news snippets.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You only need Python installed on your system. This script uses the built-in `random` module, so no external libraries are required.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the script directly):

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/fake-news-headline-generator.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/fake-news-headline-generator.git)
    cd fake-news-headline-generator
    ```

    *(**Note:** Replace `YourUsername` and the repository name with your actual details.)*

2.  **Save the Python code** as a file named `headline_generator.py`.

### Usage

1.  **Run the script** from your terminal:

    ```bash
    python headline_generator.py
    ```

2.  The script will immediately display a randomly generated headline.

    ```
    BREAKING NEWS :prime ministed modi dances with in mumbai local train

    Do you want another headline ?(yes/no)
    ```

3.  Type `yes` (or anything other than `no`) to generate another headline, or type `no` to exit the program.

## ⚙️ Customization

The core of the generator lies in the three lists defined at the beginning of the script. You can easily modify them to change the tone or content of the generated headlines:

| Variable | Description | Example Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `subjects` | The person, animal, or group acting. | `"elon musk", "my grumpy neighbor", "an ancient artifact"` |
| `actions` | The verb connecting the subject and the object/place. | `"discovers", "flies a drone over", "is caught selling"` |
| `places_or_things`| The object or location of the action. | `"a secret government base", "the moon", "a plate of biryani"` |

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have suggestions for:

* Adding more interesting subjects, actions, or places.
* Improving the code structure or functionality.
* Fixing any bugs (though in this script, "bugs" might just be extra funny headlines!).
